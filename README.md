# Back-end for a web programming project - personal portfolio

This website's back-end was done as part of a web programming project during my second year of Bachelor in Computer Science at the University of Strasbourg. (Programmation Web 2, L2S4).
The back-end part is done in *php*. 

#### It offers an API that allows to do the following actions with a MySQL database :
- get all contacts that have submitted a contact form, 
- get contact by ID, 
- add new contact upon submitting, 
- delete contact,
- change/modify contact data.

#### It is not hosted anywhere. 
If you want to test it, clone this repo, and run a local php server with index.php at the root.
